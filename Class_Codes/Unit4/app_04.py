# @description Easy, simple introduction to the
#              Python 3 programming language for
#              those who want to start coding.

# UNIT 4
# Activity 01 - Arithmetics and Operators
#
# NOTE:
# You don't have to change anything from the
# code below. This is an example I left for you
# to evaluate and use as a reference.
#
# SIDENOTE:
# The operators seen in this Unit are very similar
# to most programming languages out there, for the
# most part. Let's compare Python with Java:
#
# --- JAVA ---                |   --- PYTHON ---
# int a = 3;                  |   a = 3
# int b = 2;                  |   b = 2
# system.out.print(a < b);    |   print(a < b)
# system.out.print(a > b);    |   print(a > b)
# system.out.print(a <= b);   |   print(a <= b)
# system.out.print(a >= b);   |   print(a >= b)
# system.out.print(a == b);   |   print(a == b)
# system.out.print(a != b);   |   print(a != b)
#
# Notice how the Comparison Operators (above) are very similar
# to that of Java. In truth, most types of operators
# found in the Python language are very similar to
# those of Java. Let's try more operators examples:
#
# --- JAVA ---                              |   --- PYTHON ---
# int a = 3;                                |   a = 3
# int b = 2;                                |   b = 2
# system.out.print(a + b);                  |   print(a + b)
# system.out.print(a - b);                  |   print(a - b)
# system.out.print(a * b);                  |   print(a * b)
# system.out.print(a / b);                  |   print(a / b)
# system.out.print(a % b);                  |   print(a % b)
# system.out.print(Math.pow(a, b));         |   print(a ** b)
# system.out.print(Math.floorDiv(a, b));    |   print(a // b)
#
# When it comes to Arithmetic Operators, as seen above, Python
# trumps over Java, when it comes to simplicity, and it is much
# easier to remember the last two operators (especially),
# compared to that of Java. Let's compare another type of
# operators: the Logical Operators.
#
# --- JAVA ---                                |   --- PYTHON ---
# int a = 3;                                  |   a = 3
# int b = 2;                                  |   b = 2
# system.out.print(a == 2 && b == 3);         |   print(a == 2 and b == 3)
# system.out.print(a == 2 || b == 3);         |   print(a == 2 or b == 3)
# system.out.print( !(a == 2 && b == 3) );    |   print( not(a == 2 and b == 3) )
#
# In these last examples, you can see that Python uses words
# instead of symbols, when it comes to logic; but other than
# that, the differences are pretty slim. Now, below, I have
# written some examples of each and every Operators we've
# covered in the videos. There are many more operators in the
# Python language, but I have kept only the simplest ones
# for the class. ;)

# --------------------------------------------#
# ASSIGNMENT:
# Come up with a few arithmetic operations, logical
# operations, and comparisons of your own, following
# the model provided above. Print the results of each
# operations you compute.
# Create one or two lists and/or tuples, then use the
# Membership Operators ('in' and 'not in') to verify
# if a value is included or not.
# Create two or three variables, then use the id() function
# to determine these variables' id (memory location) and
# print them. Then use the Identity Operators ('is' and 'is not')
# to determine if these variables are the same (have the same ID),
# then print the results.
#
# NOTE: Don't forget to upload your code into your Github repository
#       (if you have created an account, or already have an account)
#       once you are done! :)
#
# OBJECTIVE:
# Operators are among the most important aspects of
# any programming languages. Understanding how to use
# them efficiently will help you majorly in writing and
# understanding coding. Actually, most complex subjects
# of Python (or any other languages) function because
# of these Operators.
