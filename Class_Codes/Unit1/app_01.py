#              those who want to start coding.

# UNIT 1
# Activity 01 - "Hello, World"
#
# NOTE:
# You don't have to change anything from the
# code below. This is an example I left for you
# to evaluate and use as a reference.
#
# SIDENOTE:
# In comparison to a lot of programming languages,
# printing a string into the Command Line is
# very easy and simple, as you see below. If you were
# to look at other languages, such as Java or C/C++,
# you would see that it is much more complex, as it
# requires more commands to make a simple line print.
# ============================================
print("Hello, World!")

# --------------------------------------------#
# ASSIGNMENT:
# Print sentence you want into the Command Line.
# Make sure you run the command in your Terminal
# to make sure your code works!
# Once your done, and if you had set up a Github
# account, make sure you upload your code to your
# repository also!
#
# OBJECTIVE:
# The goal of this assignment is to teach you
# how to print a string (we will see what 'strings'
# are in the next Unit) into your Command Line (or
# Terminal).
